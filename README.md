# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in time series data using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The aim is to identify unusual patterns that deviate from expected behavior within a sequence of time-stamped data.

## Data
This project utilizes a time series dataset to capture sequential dependencies and detect anomalies. The dataset is expected to include:
- **Timestamps** to record the timing of each data point.
- **Features** that may show temporal patterns, trends, or seasonal behavior.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install the required packages:
Dependencies may include:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- keras or tensorflow

## Project Structure
The project files are organized as follows:
- AnomalyDetection.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- README.md: Documentation of the project structure and setup.

## Modeling Techniques
Multiple approaches for anomaly detection are explored in this project:
- Statistical Models: Techniques like ARIMA or moving average methods to capture seasonality and trend.
- Machine Learning: Algorithms like isolation forests or clustering techniques tailored for time series data.
- Deep Learning: Models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, and Autoencoders, which are designed for capturing sequential dependencies.
These models are tuned to identify anomalies by analyzing deviations from normal patterns.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is measured using the following metrics:
- Precision: Measures the accuracy of detecting anomalies.
- Recall: Evaluates the model's ability to capture all anomalies.
- F1-Score: Provides a balance between precision and recall.
- ROC-AUC Score: For models that output probabilities, assessing the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
These metrics help in evaluating and refining the detection models effectively.

## Results
The results section highlights the key findings and model performance metrics obtained during the project. Summary of results will include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, depending on the chosen model and dataset.

## Usage
To execute the project:
-Open the AnomalyDetection.ipynb notebook.
-Follow each code cell sequentially, ensuring data is in the correct format.
-Adjust data loading and preprocessing steps if you use a custom dataset.
